# Example Windows Form Application using Classes

This application provides a simple search for information about Formula 1 cars using a `Formula1Car` class. It does **not** meet the entire specification for your task.

**Note:** The existing code is intentionally unoptimised, part of your task is to update it as you extend the application.

## Task

Your task is to modify and extend the application to meet the program specification given below and, time-permitting, extend it to introduce new functionality. More information will be given and documented in sessions.

### Program Specification

- Display information about [your chosen topic].
- Use a search input to filter the list of data from [your chosen topic].
- Use a button to trigger the update to the list of search results.
- Use a list box to display the information about [your chosen topic].
- Implement a way to add, delete and update information for [your chosen topic] (see 'CRUD').

### Extending the Application

You can look to extend the application beyond this specification:

- How can you filter against more attributes at once?
- How can other controls be used to provide rich user input?
- How can the list box be used to display more than simple strings in each row?
- How can the data be stored (persisted) after you've closed your application?
- Do you have your own features you'd like to implement?
